# Terraform modules to set up a VPC and EKS in AWS

These modules are used in parallel with the [cv-tg](https://github.com/stutily/cv-tg) Terragrunt configurations which define local variations in
infrastructure for these modules to set up different environments.

There are also some scripts for one time setup of components in the cluster in the scripts directory for tasks that are outside of the normal scope of terraform.
